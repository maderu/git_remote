			<h2>First off</h2>
			<p>
				Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large
				projects with speed and efficiency.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you can read only one chapter to get going with Git, this is it. This chapter covers every basic command you need to do
				the vast majority of the things you’ll eventually spend your time doing with Git. By the end of the chapter, you should
				be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes. We’ll also
				show you how to set up Git to ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to
				browse the history of your project and view changes between commits, and how to push and pull from remote repositories.
			</p>
			<h4>This is what you can do:</h4>
			<ul id="nested">
				<li>Variables <p>(With the $ character pre-pended)</p></li>
				<li>Nesting <p>(Indented, and with the &amp; character before, if you used for example :hover)</p></li>
				<li>Mixins <p>(Is defined by the @mixin followed by the mixin-name, use @include and mixin-name to add to style)</p></li>
				<li>Operators <p>(Math, who needs it, right?)</p></li>
				<li>Advanced Operators <p>(Can be used to add parameters, which can be set later in the class or id)</p></li>
				<li>Functions <p>(Text goes here)</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Nearly every VCS has some form of branching support. Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue
				to do work without messing with that main line.
			</p> 
			<p>	
				In many VCS tools, this is a somewhat expensive process, often requiring you to create a new copy of your source code directory,
				which can take a long time for large projects. Some people refer to the branching model in Git as its “killer feature” , and it
				certainly sets Git apart in the VCS community. Why is it so special? The way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making
				branching operations nearly instantaneous and switching back and forth between branches generally just as fast.
